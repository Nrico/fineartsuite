# FineArtSuite

FineArtSuite is a minimal gallery website project. This repository provides a single HTML file that serves as a starting point for displaying art online.

## Running the site locally

Any static file server can be used to host the site. The simplest method is Python's built-in server:

```bash
python3 -m http.server
```

After running the command in the project directory, visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser to view the page.

## Planned gallery features

The current page is only a basic landing page. Future improvements may include:

- A dedicated gallery page showing artwork thumbnails
- Upload functionality for adding new pieces
- Navigation enhancements and styling refinements
- Search and filtering tools for visitors
